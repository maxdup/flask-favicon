Flask-favicon is a `Flask <https://flask.palletsprojects.com>`_ extension which generates multiple favicon variants for different platforms. The goal is to cover as many devices as possible from a single image file. Flask-favicon compiles and serves all the assets for you and provides an easy to use Jinga template which you can include in your html :code:`<head>`.


Flask-favicon is largely inspired by `favicons-webpack-plugin <https://github.com/jantimon/favicons-webpack-plugin>`_.
